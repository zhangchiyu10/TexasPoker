TexasPoker
==========
Texas Hold'em is one of the world's most popular poker games. The game requires 5 community cards and 2 pocket cards for each player which comes from the same set of 52 cards. We found it encredibly annoying to shuffle the cards after each roll, so I spent an afternoon to write a web app to do the shuffle work and simulate the experience of playing the game in reality.

It is very easy to use. Just download the folder and run main.py. You need python environment of course.

python main.py 8080

Here 8080 is the port you set for your website, you can change whichever you like as long as it is available.
If your os is win8, simply double click the .bat file and it will establish a local wlan network for you as well as run the web app.
Then open your favourite web browser (Chrome recommanded). Type "localhost/banker" to see the community cards. Use your cell phone and type "yourcompurterip/player/1" to get your pocket cards. Other player can get theirs by different number specified at the url path.

Have Fun with your friends!
